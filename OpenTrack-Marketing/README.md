# Open Track: Marketing

## Marketing Plan for CC

This marketing strategy details ways in which Codeless Conduct can be promoted to attract more participants and sponsors.

### Social Media Giveaways

A good way to get engagement and more people aware of CC is the hosting of giveaways every once in a while.  
CC could mint 1/1 art NFT's that can be given as prizes for casual twitter trivia contests or just raffles.  
This would give more engagement and spread the word.

Reddit and discord are also good platforms to conduct these activities. Reddit would also help CC appear in google searches.

### Community Calls + Cryptovoxels (or other metaverses)

Community calls and meetings are a great way to engage people. If you can integrate ways for the community to 'meet up' and showcase things they're working on or learning, then you can drive engagement and growth.  
Using a metaverse platform like Cryptovoxels could help this as it introduces new users to all the fun things that they can build. CC can create events inside these virtual spaces and attract other crypto-native users as well as newer users by doing so.

### Group Hackathons

A great way to market CC is to have hackathons where you're forced to be in a group. This can make users bring their friends and colleagues into it and have the word spread around. This would also increase community engagement and encourage helping each other.

### Blog with Project Showcase

A great way to promote something is by showing the fruits of it. By having a blog showcasing winning or note-worthy projects done in the CC hackathons, the more people are encouraged to give it a try and get into the space, as it can show that all skills are welcomed in the space and that you don't need to have a coding background in order to be involved.

### Job Board & Connections

Another idea to have more involvement and people interested in participating is to ask the sponsors to provide a list of available positions (if any) on their platform. This would encourage others to participate and apply their skills into projects that might be interested in their skillset.  
Connecting participants with sponsors/mentors would also be something that would attract others to get into the space.

### Referrals

A referral program with prizes could give community members an incentive to invite others to be part of the community. To avoid exploiting the contest, it could be done in a way where referrals only count if the new members submits a bounty to a hackathon. This would both increase the engagement of the community and increase the number of members.

### Participation Merchandise

Besides POAPs, CC could provide with physical merchandise to participants or notable project submissions. This could be done with a google form sent to participants or a 1/1 NFT that can be exchanged for clothing/merch. Cool designs help as free marketing because users will wear them and they will catch the eye of people.
