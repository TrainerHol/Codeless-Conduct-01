# Codeless Conduct DAO Proposal

The following steps outline what could be a possible setup to transition Codeless Conduct into a DAO.

## Adding Membership Tokens

The first step would be to have actual membership cards (non-transfer ERC-721) that are provided to members by either:

 - Participating on the discord/community actively and given out as
   rewards. 
 - Participating on hackathons/events.
 - Sponsoring hackathons/events.
 
 The current CC team should of course get theirs at the beginning with significant voting power, as a DAO still requires structure and leadership.

## Voting Power

Each NFT could have an on-chain metadata field that could be used to quantify the voting power that person has. This would work better than using an ERC-20 because it would belong specifically to that member and it would not be transferrable. However, votes should still be delegated to another member.
Voting points could be awarded to each membership by a metric of sponsoring events (amount donated) or by participating in events (quadratic voting/votes received.)
Proposals should be made only by token holders and should require a minimum amount of voting power.

## Community Perks

 - By holding these membership cards, community members could be granted
   access to exclusive events such as: Community only hackathons.
 - Exclusive discord channels.
 - One-on-one help with sponsors or mentors outside of hackathons.
 - Early news/feedback.

## Quest Board

The DAO should then implement a job/quest board with all the different tasks that need to be done for the DAO, such as advertisement, community management, mentoring, event planning, etc.
The DAO should then vote on which tasks would be posted for the next few months and vote on the rewards that will be given to the ones that fulfill the job. 
These tasks could be rewarded using gitcoin.
